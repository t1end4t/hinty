1. How can use AI but still improve in:
   1. Creativity -> We have fewer ideas
   2. Critical thinking -> We think about them less critically
   3. Memory -> We remember them less well
   4. Metacognition -> We have harder time doing it

2. AI should be tool for thought:
   1. Do the job -> Help me understand the job
   2. Faster work -> Higher quality work
   3. Right answers -> Right question
   4. Automate the known -> Explore the unknown
